#### Explanation:
- Start - The game starts by generating a random number within a defined range.
- User Input - The user is then prompted to ender a guess.
- Invalid Input - An error message will be displayed in the event the input provided is outside the valid range or is not numeric. The user is prompted to make another guess.
- Valid Input - If the user guess is too low, the game displays "Too Low" and promts the user to guess again. Likewise if the guess is too high, the game displays "Too High" and promts the user to guess again. If the guess is correct the game displays "Correct!" and the game ends.
